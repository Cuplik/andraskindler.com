Cardio training doesn't mean it can't be done by men, you know! This exercise is very good for training the heart and lungs.

Cardio is important to your fitness success, especially if you're aiming to lose weight.

But keep in mind if too often doing cardio can be detrimental to the health of the body. Why? Here's the reason.

#1 Fat won't go away
Cardio is an activity that has benefits, one of which is to burn excess fat.

Many people favor this sport by thinking that more cardio means less fat.

In fact, when the body does too much cardio, it actually sends a signal to the body to start storing fat instead of burning it. Why so?

Launching fitnessfirst.ci.id, this happens because when you do cardio, your body reacts to stress from exercise, which suppresses an important hormone produced by the body's thyroid, which is responsible for burning fat, called the T3 hormone.

This hormone is suppressed in such a way that the body begins to gain and store body fat.

This is why excessive cardio can lead to a reduction in muscle mass due to a slower metabolism.

#2 Body muscles are not formed
For those of you who are fitness sports activists, of course it has become a dream to have charming muscle curves.

The ratio of body fat and muscle mass are the two components that make up the body.

Without muscles being built, a person will tend to look thin but not filled with good muscle mass.

So, having a generous portion of cardio is very important if you want to look not only skinny, but also full of muscle that is built.

#3 Muscles always hurt
You need to be more sensitive to distinguish between muscle pain due to exercise, or muscle pain due to injury.

If your muscles are always feeling tight and tight, pain is your body's way of telling you that you are past your body's ability to endure pain and that you need to stop immediately.

Ignoring pain to meet your exercise goals can be harmful to the body.

If you experience unbearable joint and muscle pain, this is your body's way of signaling you to take a break from vigorous exercise.

To Burn Fat but Keep Muscle Formed
When you're trying to lose weight and burn excess fat, it's natural that some muscle mass will be lost as well. However, losing a large amount of muscle mass is a pity, isn't it?

To prevent this, there are several diet programs, menus, or types of exercise that can help you lose weight, burn fat, and maintain muscle mass.

In addition to the appropriate exercise pattern, it is also necessary to pay attention to giving the right intake, here are some things that need to be considered.

#1 Calorie
Usually we are recommended to consume at least 1,200 calories per day.

Consuming calories that are too low for your age, gender, or activity level can put you at risk of losing muscle mass by not consuming enough nutrients to function normally.

To lose 0.5 or 1 kg per week can be obtained from a reduction in consumption of 500 calories per day. Do not reduce calorie consumption beyond that.

#2 Proteins
A man needs 56 grams of protein per day. That's easily fulfilled by consuming protein sources at every meal.

Should not consume less than this amount.

Eat protein from high-quality sources such as lean red meat, poultry, seafood, beans, tofu, eggs, or low-fat dairy products.

#3 Carbs
Following a low-carb diet can help you lose weight faster and burn more fat than following a low-fat or low-calorie diet.

#4 Vegetables and Fruits
When organizing and choosing weight loss foods, vegetables and fruits are mandatory menus that should not be missed.

Both food groups are low in calories, but rich in nutrients and can fill you up more. In order to maximize, you should eat fruit or vegetables at every meal.
