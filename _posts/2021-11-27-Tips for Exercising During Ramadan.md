After previously discussing the impact of fasting in Ramadan for sports activities from a scientific perspective, the next question that naturally arises is: How to get around to exercising while fasting in Ramadan?

Again we remind, there is no reason for us not to exercise during Ramadan.

The body still needs physical exercise to stay healthy and fit. Exercise will also make the body fresher and not even feel weak. In addition, this sometimes becomes important for all of us: exercise can help the body burn fat deposits.

Based on several scientific journals, exercise strategy during Ramadan generally talks a lot about the intensity and also the right time to exercise. While nutritional demands also appear automatically, we will discuss nutrition tips in the next article.

One of the most important things that we must always remember is that we must always adjust the exercise we do with the condition of the body that is fasting.

Here are some tips for exercising during Ramadan, especially for us as the general public (non-athletes). As for athletes, the approach will be very different even though they generally have the same characteristics.

Lower the intensity level of our exercise

When fasting, naturally there will be a decrease in the body's metabolism. This happens because the intake of energy (nutrients from food and drink) is limited. In general, low to moderate levels of exercise or exercise are the most recommended to overcome the above.

While forcing yourself to do high-intensity exercise will actually make you feel weak.

Then for those who have a history of worrying health, such as heart disease, stroke, or high blood pressure, many journals suggest that the intensity of exercise is reduced to 60 to 65 percent of the usual intensity.

Tips on types of low to moderate intensity exercise that are suitable for fasting: Walking (can walk briskly) to leisurely jogging, light cycling with a path that does not climb, cleaning the house, body stretching movements (even body stretching in the office as we have discussed) , and light exercise.

Best tip: Many journals discuss that light exercise yoga is the most helpful for us when fasting. Besides being useful for health, yoga can also calm our minds.

Next: Time to exercise

Sports in the morning

This may not be common, but in fact we can still do good exercise in the morning during fasting. Exercise in the morning is fine because the muscle tissue is already active and ready to train.

Usually morning exercise is done after sahur, about 2-3 hours after we close our meal. But depending on what kind of intake we eat that affects the type of exercise that is recommended.

We can engage in moderate-intensity exercise but risk running out of energy too early. The right exercise in the morning is a leisurely walk or cycling, while for example walking to the mosque for the morning prayer in congregation, then returning home with a little circling path, about 30 minutes, in order to get the right duration.

Another "sport" of cleaning the house can also be a profitable solution.

Exercise just before breaking the fast

This term is very well known in Indonesia as Â¿Â½"ngabuburitÃ¯Â¿Â½". Several journals suggest that exercise is done at this time, which is just before breaking the fast.

In fact, ngabuburit is mostly done, especially by children, because the remaining energy and body fluids that run out in the afternoon can be immediately returned by eating and drinking during iftar. Very logical.

Normally, the afternoon exercise is done two hours before breaking the fast, which also means that the exercise is carried out for a duration of no more than two hours (no more than 120 minutes, or recommended minutes).

One thing that must be considered is for us not to push ourselves, because after all at a time like this is a time where the remaining energy and body fluids are crucial.

Sports games are very popular during ngabuburit, such as futsal, football, badminton, volleyball, and so on. The harder we exercise in the afternoon, usually it will directly affect the amount of nutrient intake that we enter (eat and drink) when breaking the fast.

Meanwhile, for those of us who like to lift weights in the gym, we are advised to pay attention to exercise variables such as volume, sets, and repetitions that are adapted to the conditions of our physiological changes during fasting.

However, many journals recommend doing weightlifting when the body is not fasting, especially in the afternoon when the remaining energy is at the least level, although ngabuburit can sometimes be an exception.

Exercise after breaking the fast

In addition to ngabuburit, exercising after breaking the fast (at night) is very popular. Exercise after breaking the fast can be done because it provides an opportunity for us to eat and drink before, during, and after exercise.

Exercise after breaking the fast can be done at any time, but it is recommended that it be done as early as an hour and a half (90 minutes) after we break our fast. This is done to reduce the risk of damage to muscle tissue because the muscles are not fully ready to be given a load.

At this time, any type of exercise, whether individual sports, weight lifting, cardio, or game sports, does not have as high a risk as exercising in the morning or evening when fasting. We can do sports and exercise in high-intensity gyms at this time. Many suggest a workout duration of around 30 minutes.

But the length of the duration does not have a definite reference because it is influenced by the type of exercise and also what kind of nutritional menu and how much we eat during iftar (before we do exercise) and during exercise.

Unlike suggestions for exercise before breaking the fast, many journals suggest that periodic competitions or sporting events can be held only in the evening, rather than in the afternoon.

Sports before dawn

Of the many sports, if we like running or cardio (on a treadmill), the best time to do it is before dawn. Yes, this really is the result of scientific research! Exercising at this time will allow us to lose fat optimally.

Of course, most people won't want to get up around 2:00 in the morning to run. If you can and are willing to do this, then the best thing to start with is to get up and drink plenty of water with a cup of coffee or green tea, wait 30 minutes, and do a few minutes of moderate-intensity running or cardio.

Best tip: Running or cardio with high intensity and short duration is the best type of exercise during Ramadan to do from after iftar until before dawn. The duration required is not up to 10 minutes but is able to produce maximum benefits. This exercise involves sprinting (running really fast, like being chased by a dog) for a second, then walking for a minute, and repeating this cycle 4-5 times.

Exercise while fasting... Tired, you know, don't worry!

So, now we know when to exercise and what sports are suitable during Ramadan fasting. Now finally we have no more excuses not to exercise in Ramadan.

After understanding the impact, then how to get around it, next we will discuss the direct relationship between exercise and fasting, namely nutritional intake.
